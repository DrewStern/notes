Technopoly
Neil Postman

* 01 The Judgment of Thamus
"Every technology is both a burden and a blessing; not either-or, but this-and-that"
"every culture must negotiate with technology, whether it does so intelligently or not"
"our inventions are but improved means to an unimproved end."
"those who cultivate competence in the use of a new technology becom an elite group that are granted undeserved authority and prestige by those who have no such competence."
"language is not merely a vehicle of thought but also the driver"
"new technologies compete with old ones- for time, for attention, for money, for prestige, but mostly for dominance of their world-view."
"'conceit of wisdom' - the unreal knowledge acquired through the written word"
"Orality stresses group learning, cooperation, and a sense of social responsibility."
"Print stresses individualized learning, competition, and personal autonomy."
