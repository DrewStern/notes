The Bitcoin Standard: The Decentralized Alternative to Central Banking
Saifedean Ammous

* 0 Prologue
"Bitcoin automates the functions fo a modern central bank and makes them predictable and virtually immutable by programming them into code decentralized among thousands of network members, none of whom can alter the code without the consent of the rest."
"Money is the information and measurement system of an economy"

* 1 Money
"Bitcoin is the newest technology to serve the function of money - an invention [...] to solve a problem that has persisted for all of humanity's existence: how to move economic value across time and space."
"Throughout human history, many things have served the function of money: gold and silver, most notably, but also copper, seashells, large stones, salt, cattle, government paper, precious stones, and even alcohol and cigaretters in cerain conditions."
"We can understand money's hardness through understanding two distinct quantities related to the supply of a good: (1) the stock, [...] and (2) the flow. The ration between the stock and flow is a reliable indicator of a good's hardness as money."
"easy money trap: anything used as a store of value will have its supply increased, and anything whose supply can be easily increased will destroy the wealth of those who used it as a store of value."
"Competition is at all times alive between monetary media"

* 2 Primitive Money
"the world salary is derived from sal, the Latin word for salt"
"As soon as these moneys [seashells, etc] lose their hardness, their holders suffered significant wealth expropriation and the entire fabric of their society fell apart as a result. [...] a money that is easy to produce is no money at all, and easy money does not make a society richer, on the contrary , it makes it poorer by placing all its hard-earned wealth for sale in exchange for something easy to produce."

* 3 Monetary Metals
"Gold coins were the goods most salable across time, because they could hold their value over time and resist decay and ruin. They were also the goods most salable across space, beause they carried a lot of value in samll weights, allowing for easy transportation. Silver coins, on the other hand, had the advantage of being the most salable good across scales, because their lower value per weight unit compared to gold allowed for them to conveniently serve as a medium of exchange for small transactions, while bronze coins would be useful for the least valuable transactions."
"[...] governments and counterfeiters could, and frequently did, reduce the precious metal content in these coins, causing their value to decline by transferring a fraction of their puchasing power to the counterfeiters or the government."
"For anything to function as a good store of value, it has to beat this trap: it has to appreciate when people demand it as a store of value, but its producers have to be constrained from inflating the supply significantly enough to bring the price down."
"[the gold] growth rate has always been around 1.5%, never exceeding 2%"
"Only silver comes close to gold in this regard, with an annual supply growth rate historically around 5-10%, rising to around 20% in the modern day"
"second place in monetary competition was equivalent to losing out"
"Human civilization flourished in times and places where sound money was widely adopted, while unsound money all too frequently coincided with civilizational decline and societal collapse."
Roman emperor Nero (who ruled from 54-68 AD) was the first to engage in coin clipping, "wherein the Emperor would collec tthe coins of the population and mint them into newer coins with less gold or silver content."
This "was highly similar yo Keyne's solution [...]: devaluing the currency would at once reduce the real wages of workers, reduce the burden of the government in subsidizing staples, and provide increased money for financing other government expenditure."
"Seventeen centuries of people the world over have used [the Roman solidus, the Constantinople's bezant, or the Islamic dinar - all containing 4.5g of gold] this coin for transactions, emphasizing the salability of gold across time."
"It is the author's opinion that the history of China and India, and their failure to catch up to the West during the twentieth century, is inextricably linked to this massive destruction of wealth and capital brought about by the demonetization of the monetary metal [silver instead of gold] that these countries utilized."
"domestic hard money was easy money for foreigners, and was being driven out by foreign hard money"
"History shows it is not possible to insulate yourself from the consequences of others holding money that is harder than yours."
"Nineteenth-century sound money economists [...] focused their understanding of (i) money's soundness on its salability as a market good, and (ii) money's soundness on its resistance to control by a sovereign."
During the period of the gold standard, "it was possible to circumnavigate the globe and use one form of money everywhere"
"Even as central banks repeatedly declared the end of gold's monetary role, their actions in maintaining their gold reserves ring truer."
