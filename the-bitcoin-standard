The Bitcoin Standard: The Decentralized Alternative to Central Banking
Saifedean Ammous

* 0 Prologue
"Bitcoin automates the functions fo a modern central bank and makes them predictable and virtually immutable by programming them into code decentralized among thousands of network members, none of whom can alter the code without the consent of the rest."
"Money is the information and measurement system of an economy"

* 1 Money
"Bitcoin is the newest technology to serve the function of money - an invention [...] to solve a problem that has persisted for all of humanity's existence: how to move economic value across time and space."
"Throughout human history, many things have served the function of money: gold and silver, most notably, but also copper, seashells, large stones, salt, cattle, government paper, precious stones, and even alcohol and cigaretters in cerain conditions."
"We can understand money's hardness through understanding two distinct quantities related to the supply of a good: (1) the stock, [...] and (2) the flow. The ration between the stock and flow is a reliable indicator of a good's hardness as money."
"easy money trap: anything used as a store of value will have its supply increased, and anything whose supply can be easily increased will destroy the wealth of those who used it as a store of value."
"Competition is at all times alive between monetary media"

* 2 Primitive Money
"the world salary is derived from sal, the Latin word for salt"
"As soon as these moneys [seashells, etc] lose their hardness, their holders suffered significant wealth expropriation and the entire fabric of their society fell apart as a result. [...] a money that is easy to produce is no money at all, and easy money does not make a society richer, on the contrary , it makes it poorer by placing all its hard-earned wealth for sale in exchange for something easy to produce."

* 3 Monetary Metals
"Gold coins were the goods most salable across time, because they could hold their value over time and resist decay and ruin. They were also the goods most salable across space, beause they carried a lot of value in samll weights, allowing for easy transportation. Silver coins, on the other hand, had the advantage of being the most salable good across scales, because their lower value per weight unit compared to gold allowed for them to conveniently serve as a medium of exchange for small transactions, while bronze coins would be useful for the least valuable transactions."
"[...] governments and counterfeiters could, and frequently did, reduce the precious metal content in these coins, causing their value to decline by transferring a fraction of their puchasing power to the counterfeiters or the government."
"For anything to function as a good store of value, it has to beat this trap: it has to appreciate when people demand it as a store of value, but its producers have to be constrained from inflating the supply significantly enough to bring the price down."
"[the gold] growth rate has always been around 1.5%, never exceeding 2%"
"Only silver comes close to gold in this regard, with an annual supply growth rate historically around 5-10%, rising to around 20% in the modern day"
"second place in monetary competition was equivalent to losing out"
"Human civilization flourished in times and places where sound money was widely adopted, while unsound money all too frequently coincided with civilizational decline and societal collapse."
Roman emperor Nero (who ruled from 54-68 AD) was the first to engage in coin clipping, "wherein the Emperor would collect the coins of the population and mint them into newer coins with less gold or silver content."
This "was highly similar to Keyne's solution [...]: devaluing the currency would at once reduce the real wages of workers, reduce the burden of the government in subsidizing staples, and provide increased money for financing other government expenditure."
"Seventeen centuries of people the world over have used [the Roman solidus, the Constantinople's bezant, or the Islamic dinar - all containing 4.5g of gold] this coin for transactions, emphasizing the salability of gold across time."
"It is the author's opinion that the history of China and India, and their failure to catch up to the West during the twentieth century, is inextricably linked to this massive destruction of wealth and capital brought about by the demonetization of the monetary metal [silver instead of gold] that these countries utilized."
"domestic hard money was easy money for foreigners, and was being driven out by foreign hard money"
"History shows it is not possible to insulate yourself from the consequences of others holding money that is harder than yours."
"Nineteenth-century sound money economists [...] focused their understanding of (i) money's soundness on its salability as a market good, and (ii) money's soundness on its resistance to control by a sovereign."
During the period of the gold standard, "it was possible to circumnavigate the globe and use one form of money everywhere"
"Even as central banks repeatedly declared the end of gold's monetary role, their actions in maintaining their gold reserves ring truer."

* 4 Government Money
"With irredeemable government money, on the other hand, government's debt and/or paper is used as money, and the government is able to increase its supply as it sees fit."
"it was not government that decreed gold as money; rather, it was only by holding hold that governments could get their money to be accepted at all."
"With the simple suspension of gold redeemability, governments' war efforts were no longer limited to the money that they had in their own treasuries, but extended virtually to the entire wealth of the population"
"But with the suspension of the gold standard, running out of financing was not enough to end the war; a sovereign had to run out of its people's accumulated wealth expropriated through inflation."
"President Roosevelt issued an execute order banning the private ownership of gold, forcing Americans to sell their gold to the US Treasury at a rate of $20.67 per ounce. With the population deprived of sound money, and aforced to deal with dollars, Roosevelt then revalued the dollar on the international market from $20.67 per ounce to $35 per ounce, a 41% devaluation fo the dollar in real terms (gold)."
"Government is immune to the concept of opportunity costs"
"If soldiers are not to cross international borders, goods must do so."
"It is well-known that history is written by the victors, but in the era of government money, victors get to decide on the monetary systems, too."
"the US government promised to redeem dollars in gold to other countries central banks at a fixed rate, opening what was known as the gold exchange window." [...] "On August 15, 1971 President Nixon announced the end of dollar convertibility into gold." [...] "In effect, the US had defaulted on its commitment to redeem its dollars in gold."
"When a country's currency is devalued, its products become cheaper to foreigners, leading to more goods leaving the country, while holders of the currency seek to purchase foreign currencies to protect themselves from devaluation. As devaluation is usually accompanied by artificially low interest rates, capital seeks exit from the country to go where it can be better rewarded, exacerbating the devaluation of the currency."
"In the presence of fiat money to finance government, political differences between parties disappear as politics no longer contains trade-offs and every candidate can champion every cause."
"The market for foreign exchange, at $5 trillion of daily volume, exists purely as a result of this inefficiency of the absence of a single global homogeneous international currency."
"[...] the currencies that are most accepted worldwide, and have the highest salability globally, have a higher stock-to-flow ratio than the other currencies"
"Growth at 5% per year may not sound like much, but it will double the money supply of a country in only 15 years."
"In 2003, when the US invaded Iraq, aerial bombardment destroyed the Iraqi central bank and with it the capability of the Iraqi government to print new Iraqi dinars. This led to the dinar drastically appreciating overnight as Iraqis became more confident in the currency given that no central bank could print it anymore. A similar story happened to the Somali shillings are their central bank was destroyed. Money is more desirable when demonstrably scarce than when liable to being debased."
"Indians who woke up on November 8, 2016 to hear that their government had suspended the legal tender status of 500 and 1000 rupee notes"
"Government control of money has turned money from being the reward for producting value to the reward for obedience to government officials"
"value does not exist outside of human consciousness"

* 5 Money and Time Preference
"Time preference refers tot he ratio at which individuals value the present compared to the future"
"[...] time preference is positive for all humans; there is always a discount on the future compared to the present"
"the most important economic decisions to any individual's well-being are the ones they conduct in their trade-offs with their future self."
"The sobering reality to keep in mind is that a man's lot in life will be largely determined by these trades between him and his future self."
"Civilization is not about more capital accumulation per se; rather, it is about what capital accumulation allows humans to achieve, the flourishing and freedom to seek hgiher meaning in life when their base needs ar emet and most pressing dangers averted."
"The better the money is at holding its value, the more it incentivizes people to delay consumption"
"The reduction in the purchasing power of money is similar to a form of taxation or expropriation, reducing the real value of one's money even while the nominal value is constant. In modern economies government-issues money is inextricably linked to artifically lower interest rates, which is a desirable goal for modern economicsts because it promotes bnorrowwing and investing. But the effect of this manipulation of the price of capital is to artifically reduce the interest rate that accrues to savers and investors, asd well as the one paid by borrowers. The natural implication of this process is to reduce savings and increase borrowing. At the margin, individuals will consume more of their income and borrow more against the future. This will not just have implications on their time preference in financial decisions; it will likely reflect on everything in their lives."
"Unlike all other goods, money's functions as a mdeium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account are completely orthogonal to its quantity."
"The reality of monetary competition constantly has disadvantaged individuals and societies that invest their savings in metals other than gold while rewarding those who invest their savings in gold, because it cannot be inflated easily and because it forces people to direct their energies away from producing a monetary good and toward producing more useful goods and services."
"money is the market good with the least diminishing marginal utility"
"Even the best-performing and most stable governemnt forms of money have witnessed their value decimated compared to gold, with their value currently running at around 2-3% of their value in 1971 when they were all delinked from gold. This does not represent a rise in the market value of gold, but rather a drop in the value of fiat currencies. When comparing prices of goods and services to the value of government money and gold, we find a significant rise in their prices as expressed in government money, but relative stability in their prices in gold."
"The average savings rate of the seven largest advanced economies was 12.66% in 1970, but has dropped to 3.39% in 2015"
HL Mencken: "Every election is an advanced auction on stolen goods."
