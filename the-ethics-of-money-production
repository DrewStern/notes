* Preface 
"the production of money is perverted into an instrument of exploitation"
"[...] a free market in money production is ethically superior to its logical alternative: money production based on legal exemptions and privileges."

* Introduction
** Money Production and Justice
"Money is omnipresent in modern life, yet the production of money does not seem to warrant any moral assessment."
"Adam Smith and many of his followers have called economics a moral science, and rightly so. Economics not only deals with moral beings - human persons - but it also addresses a great number of questions that have direct moral relevance. [...] In the present case, this concerns most notably the quesation of whether any social benefits can be derived from the political manipulation oft he money supply, or the question of how inflation affects the moral and spiritual disposition of the population"
"We will argue that natural money production can work; that it has worked whereever it has been tried; and that there are no tenable technical, economic, legal, moral, or spiritual reasons to suppress its operation. By contrast, there are a great number of considerations that prove conclusively the harmful and evil character of inflation. And in our time inflation has become persistent and aggravated because various legal provisions actually protect the monetary institutions that produce this inflation."

** Remarks about Relevant Literature

* Part 1: The Natural Production of Money
** Monies
*** The Division of Labor Without Money
"The fundamental law of production is that joint production yields a greater return than isolated production. Two individuals working in isolation from one another produce less physical goods and services than if they coordinated their efforts. This is probably the most momentous fact of social life."

*** The Origin and Nature of Money
"How does a commodity such as gold or silver turn into money? This happens through a gradual process, in the course of which more and more market participants, each for himself, decide to use gold and silver rather than other commodities. [...] it resulted from the spontaneous convergence of many individual choices"
"To be spontaneously adopted as a medium of exchange, a commodity must be desired for its nonmonetary services."

*** Natural Monies
"Notice that natural money is an eminently social institution. This is so not only in the sense that it is used in interpersonal exchanges (all monies are so used), but also in the sense that they owe their existence exclusively to the fact that they satisfy human needs better than any other medium of exhcnage. As soon as this is no longer the case, the market participants will choose to discard them and adopt other monies. This freedom of choice assures, so to speak, a grass-roots democratic selection of the best available monies - the natural monies."
"But wherever people are not free to choose the best available monies, a different type of money comes into existence - 'forced money.' Its characteristic feature is that it owes its existence to violations of property rights. It is used, at least to some extent, because superior alternative monies cannot be used without exposing the user to violence. It follows that such monies are tainted from a moral point of view. They may still be beneficial and used in indirect exchanges, but they are in any case less beneficial than natural monies, because they owe their existence to violations of private property, rather than to their relative superiority in satisfying human needs alone."

*** Credit Money
"Natural money must possess two qualities. It must first of all be valuable prior to its monetary use, and it must furthermore be physically suitable to be used as a medium of exchange"
[AMS: Seems that Bitcoin defies both of these qualities?]

*** Paper Money and the Free Market
"But the contention that gold, silver, and copper are the best available monies seems to be contradicted by the fact that, today, there is virtually no country in the world that uses precious metals as monies. Rather, all countries use paper monies."
"By its very nature, paper money provides only monetary services, whereas commodity money provides two kinds of services: monetary and commodity services. It follows that the prices paid for paper money can shrink to zero, whereas the price of commodity money, will always be positive as long as it attracts a nonmonetary demand. If the prices paid for a paper money fall to zero, then this money can never be re-monetized again, because short of an already-existing price system the market participants could not evaluate the money unit. Thus the use of paper money carries the risk of toal and permanent value annihilation. This risk does not exist in the case of commodity money, which always carries a positive price and which can therefore always be re-monetized."

*** Electric Money
"An economic good that is defined entirely in terms of bits and bytes is unlikely ever to be produced spontaneously on a free market, for the very same reasons that we just discussed in the case of paper money. And despite the dedicated efforts of various individuals and associations, no such money has in fact ever been produced since the creation of the Internet made electronic payments possible."
[AMS: this book was published in 2008, pre-Bitcoin]

** Money Certificates
*** Certificates Physically Integrated with Money
"Economic science has put us in a position to understand that competitive coinage is an even better way of preserving the trustworthiness of coins. There is no economic reason not to allow every private citizen to enter the minting business and to offer his own coins."
[AMS: this really takes a new spin, again with the hindsight of Bitcoin]
